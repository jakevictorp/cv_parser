# cv_parser


This tool generates a visual timeline of events (jobs held, academic degress, etc.), which are categorised as either professional or academic.

It takes as input a text file, which can be the text copied directly from a candidate's CV.

This repository contains two example CVs to parse out. The run_me.sh file will generate timelines for these two example CVs. The user can test the tool out on any CV by creating a .txt file containing the text of the CV and adding the name of the .txt file to the run_me.sh file.
